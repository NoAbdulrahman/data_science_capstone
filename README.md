## Project motivation
One of the most interesting tasks to improve businesses is exploring the relationships between the demographic data of customers and the products or offers they care about. In this project, we analyze the Starbucks data about their customers and offers. We aim to see which factors have effects on the action of the customer. This would help in improving the process of sending offers to each group of customers and therefore encouraging them to pay and complete the offers.  The project has three main stages: data cleaning, data analysis and modeling.

## Installation
Python3 with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- math
- json
- sklearn
- seaborn

## Files description
Starbucks data includes three datasets:
- Profile dataset containing data about the customers.
- Portfolio dataset containing data about the offers
- Transacript dataset containing data about the events (either offers or transactions)

## Results
Some of the analysis results we obtained are:
- Most of the transactions are done without paying attention to the offers
- Most of the offers are received or viewed but not completed
- BOGO and discount offers are the most common types of offers
- BOGO offers are more likely to be viewed than discount offers, but discount offers are actually more likely to be completed than BOGO offers.
- Offers with 10 rewards are viewed more than those of rewards 2, but offers with 2 rewards are completed than those of 10 rewards.
- The amount that customers usually pay increases linearly by increasing the customers incomes.
- Female customers are more likely to complete the offers they view.
