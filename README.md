## Project motivation
One of the most important tasks to improve businesses is exploring the relationships between the demographic data of customers and the products or offers they care about. In this project, we analyze the Starbucks data about their customers and offers. We aim to see which factors have an effect on the action of the customers with different types of offers. This might help in improving the process of sending offers to each group of customers. In this project, we cover, data cleaning, data analysis and modeling.
